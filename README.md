# Breathing-App

App containing a walkthrough of basic breathing exercises. This is a class project for CS 4261 and is soley being used as a way to practice app development skills. For this, I chose to develop using javascript with ReactNative and Expo. Project is exclusively worked on by hannah-hags.

App.js currently contains the first breathing exercise 
Branch startscreen-edits contains in progress code for the start screen that has not been integrated with the rest of the app yet.
