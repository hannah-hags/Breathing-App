# Breathing-App

App containing a walkthrough of basic breathing exercises. This is a class project for CS 4261 and is soley being used as a way to practice app development skills. For this, I chose to develop using javascript with ReactNative and Expo. The app can be viewed on a mobile phone using the Expo Go app. 

Project is exclusively worked on by hannah-hags.

## Components
App.js contains navigation features connecting the three other files

StartScreen.js contains code and details for the first screen that appears when the app is opened. Pressing the Begin button navigates to SelectionScreen.js

SelectionScreen.js contains buttons leading to all offered breathing exercises. Only one is currently available.

breathingExercise1.js walks the user through a basic 4-7-8 breathing exercise once the Begin button has been pressed.
